# MAPIT - UI Test Migration Across Mobile Platforms

MAPIT, is a tool for bi-directional UI test transfer between pairs of  "sibling'' Android and iOS apps. It does not assume that the apps' source code is available, and is capable of transferring tests containing oracles in addition to UI events.

This is the source code and data for the ASE 2021 Submission "Cross Platform UI Test Migration".

This repository contains MAPIT's source code and data, including the translated input tests in MAPIT internal representation for both [iOS](https://github.com/ase-test-migration/test-migration/tree/master/python-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/ase-test-migration/test-migration/tree/master/python-android), and examples of [transferred tests](https://github.com/ase-test-migration/test-migration/tree/master/generated_tests). 

The installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/ase-test-migration/test-migration/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
